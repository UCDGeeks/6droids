Compiling and Running the System
================================

* Minmum Requirements :
* JDK version 1.7 or higher
* NetBeans version 8.0

-------------------------

First extract the Zip file and open the "APAS" folder from NetBeans IDE as a Java SE Project.
Then build the project.
Afet bulding the project user can run the project.
To load the First Student Dataset to the system user need to click the "Load Dataset" button since the data file is not hard coded in the system.

==================================================
Common Erros when Compiling and Running the System
==================================================

If the format of the data set is not in the tsv format there will be a file reading error.

======================
Functionality Achieved
======================

Energy and Fitness functions has implemnetd to algorithms accurately.
Succesfully generated Random Intial Valus to two algorithms seperately.
The system has build up to view the final result through GUI in a user friendly way.

====================================
Design Discussion and Implementation
====================================

The Final Report has done in detail and the source code has done with the use of document comments to describe the implementation.
